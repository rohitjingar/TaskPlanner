# Task Management System

## Overview
The Task Management System is a web application designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. It allows users to create, edit, delete, and track tasks across different categories such as Pending, In Progress, Completed, Deployed, and Deferred. This system provides a user-friendly interface for managing tasks and provides features such as task assignment, priority settings, and date tracking.

## Features
- Create tasks with titles, descriptions, teams, assignees, priorities, and status.
- Categorize tasks into different statuses: Pending, In Progress, Completed, Deployed, and Deferred.
- Edit existing tasks, including updating titles, descriptions, assignees, priorities, and status.
- Delete tasks from the system.
- Filter tasks based on assignees, priorities, start date, and end date.
- Sort tasks by priority, start date, and end date.
- Display notifications for successful task edits and deletions.

## Technologies Used
